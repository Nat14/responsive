          <strong>94 Aero Squadron</strong><br/><br/>
          It would be difficult to find another restaurant with as much warmth and charm as the 94th Aero Squadron. Located inside a replica of a World War I French farmhouse, the restaurant sits overlooking Montgomery Field Airport, and is packed full of military memorabilia, antique farm implements, and aviation relics. The interior is cozy and romantic, with huge stone fireplaces, masses of hanging green plants, dark wood paneling, beamed ceilings, and old airplane wings hanging over the dining area. There are even headphones at some of the tables for diners to listen to the FAA control tower.
On warm evenings and at lunchtime you can sit outdoors on a grassy embankment at umbrella topped tables and be surrounded by an old model airplane, an army jeep, and a duck pond.</p>
